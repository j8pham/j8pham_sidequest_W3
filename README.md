## Description

A Stranger in Town is an interactive story game where you wake up in a weird town with no memory of who you are. You make choices at different spots like the diner, police station, and sketchy back alleys to figure out your past.

The game tracks three stats: Memory (figuring out who you are), Trust (if people believe you), and Suspicion (if the cops are onto you).

Your choices matter across about 20 scenes and lead to 4 different endings: Redemption, Justice, Expose, or Dark Path. You also collect items like a locker key, journal, and evidence that unlock certain story paths.
